#Contibuting to Eden

##Setting up your machine with the Eden repository and your fork

1. Fork the main Eden repository (https://github.com/Openovate/eden)
2. Fire up your local terminal and clone the MAIN EDEN REPOSITORY (git clone git://github.com/Openovate/eden.git)
3. Add your FORKED EDEN REPOSITORY as a remote (git remote add fork git@github.com:<github_username>/eden.git)

##Making pull requests

1. Before anything, make sure to update the main Eden repository. (git checkout master; git pull origin master)
2. Once updated with the latest code, create a new branch with a branch name describing what your changes are (git checkout -b bugfix/fix-twitter-auth)
    Possible types:
    - bugfix
    - feature
    - improvement
3. Make your code changes. Always make sure to sign-off on all commits made (git commit -s -m "Commit message")
4. Once you've committed all the code to this branch, push the branch to your FORKED EDEN REPOSITORY (git push fork bugfix/fix-twitter-auth)
5. Go back to your FORKED EDEN REPOSITORY on GitHub and submit a pull request.
6. An Eden developer will review your code and merge it in when it has been classified as suitable.
